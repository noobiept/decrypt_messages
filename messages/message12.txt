The xml specification mandates that all conforming xml parsers employ “draconian error handling.” That is, they must halt and catch fire as soon as they detect any sort of well-formedness error in the xml document. Well-formedness errors include mismatched start and end tags, undefined entities, illegal Unicode characters, and a number of other esoteric rules. This is in stark contrast to other common formats like html — your browser doesn't stop rendering a web page if you forget to close an html tag or escape an ampersand in an attribute value.
