Bytes are bytes; characters are an abstraction. A string is a sequence of Unicode characters. But a file on disk is not a sequence of Unicode characters; a file on disk is a sequence of bytes. So if you read a “text file” from disk, how does Python convert that sequence of bytes into a sequence of characters? It decodes the bytes according to a specific character encoding algorithm and returns a sequence of Unicode characters (otherwise known as a string).
