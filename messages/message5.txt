If your goal can be accomplished with string methods, you should use them. They’re fast and simple and easy to read, and there’s a lot to be said for fast, simple, readable code. But if you find yourself using a lot of different string functions with if statements to handle special cases, or if you’re chaining calls to split() and join() to slice-and-dice your strings, you may need to move up to regular expressions.
