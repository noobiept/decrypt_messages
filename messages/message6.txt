Having grown up the son of a librarian and an English major, I have always been fascinated by languages. Not programming languages. Well yes, programming languages, but also natural languages. Take English. English is a schizophrenic language that borrows words from German, French, Spanish, and Latin (to name a few). Actually, “borrows” is the wrong word; “pillages” is more like it. Or perhaps “assimilates” — like the Borg. Yes, I like that.
