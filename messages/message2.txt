The major difference between tuples and lists is that tuples can not be changed. In technical terms, tuples are immutable. In practical terms, they have no methods that would allow you to change them. Lists have methods like append(), extend(), insert(), remove(), and pop(). Tuples have none of these methods. You can slice a tuple (because that creates a new tuple), and you can check whether a tuple contains a particular value (because that doesn't change the tuple), and… that’s about it.
