The most important thing to understand about any type of web service is that network access is incredibly expensive. I don’t mean “dollars and cents” expensive (although bandwidth ain’t free). I mean that it takes an extraordinary long time to open a connection, send a request, and retrieve a response from a remote server. Even on the fastest broadband connection, latency (the time it takes to send a request and start retrieving data in a response) can still be higher than you anticipated. A router misbehaves, a packet is dropped, an intermediate proxy is under attack — there’s never a dull moment on the public internet, and there may be nothing you can do about it.
